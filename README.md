## Building and previewing the site locally

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
